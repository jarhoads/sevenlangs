# These are source files for my attempts at finishing Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

My First Time with Ruby and io
------------------------------

I got this book for my birthday last year and have been slowly making my way through it.
It probably would have gone a little smoother if the first two languages weren't Ruby and 
io. I've never used either of these languages and so it took a while to understand how to use them.

Ruby
----

I thought the language is interesting but 
I'm not sure I'd be willing to use it in pro
duction for any large projects.

io
--

This language was very strange and led to a lot of frustration. 
The community is small and it was difficult to find information when trying to figure things out.

Testing
-------

I like to write tests for two reasons: to make sure the solution is correct and 
to remember how to use it when I go back to it. It was difficult to figure out how to
test some of these because the languages were new to me. I didn't really look into learning
a test framework since the problems were small and pretty self contained. I tried though.
